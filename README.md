## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  
The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (There’s only master branch.)
2. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

## Working with the environment

To log in to the local Wordpress installation:

`http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/` the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

You can access phpMyAdmin:

`http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/` with username `wordpress`, password `wordpress`.

## A Few Details

* If you're needing a password (for anything - including mysql, it should be `vagrant`)
